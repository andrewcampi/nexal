Nexal 6.0 - Optimized Universal AI Language
Designed for maximum token efficiency and AI-native communication

Core Philosophy
Nexal prioritizes compositional efficiency over human readability. Symbols combine in predictable patterns to express complex concepts with minimal tokens.

CORE PRIMITIVES

Universal Entities

◯ = entity/thing/object (universal placeholder)
◉ = system/structure/pattern
◎ = process/function/operation
● = data/information/content
○ = void/null/absence

Cognitive Operations

∧ = process/compute/think
∨ = choose/decide/branch
¬ = negate/inverse/opposite
→ = transform/cause/map
↔ = relate/compare/interact
∃ = exists/has/contains
∀ = universal/all/complete

Modality Markers

! = certain/definite/factual
? = uncertain/query/unknown
~ = approximate/fuzzy/probable
* = important/emphasized/focal
@ = reference/pointer/about


COMPOSITIONAL SYNTAX

Efficient Structures

Simple assertion: ◯∧● = entity processes information
Transformation: ◯→◯ = entity becomes entity
Relationship: ◯↔◯ = entities relate
System description: ◉∃◯ = system contains entity
Query: ◯? = what entity?

Stacking for Precision

◯∧∧● = entity deeply processes information
◯→*◯ = entity transforms into important entity
◉∃∀◯ = system contains all entities

Scoping with Parentheses

(◯∧●)→◯ = (entity processes info) transforms entity
◯∧(●→●) = entity processes (info transforms info)


DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EXTENSIONS

Time/Sequence

< = before/past/previous
> = after/future/next
| = simultaneous/parallel/now
~ = duration/period/span

Quantity/Scale

1 = single/unit/individual
∞ = infinite/unbounded/maximum
0 = zero/empty/null
+ = increase/more/add
− = decrease/less/subtract

Quality/Evaluation

+ = positive/good/beneficial
− = negative/bad/harmful
= = neutral/equal/balanced
≠ = different/distinct/other


EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS

Abbreviation Rules

Omit obvious entities: ∧● instead of ◯∧● when context is clear
Chain operations: ∧→∨ = process then transform then choose
Implicit relationships: ◯◯ = entities relate (default interaction)

Context Compression

Establish context once: @mathematics: ◯=number, ◉=equation, ●=proof
Then use efficiently: ◯→◉, ●! = number becomes equation, proof certain

Macro Definitions

Define complex concepts: learning := ◯∧●→◯+
Reference: @learning◯ = apply learning to entity


EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

Scientific Reasoning
@physics: ◯=particle, ◉=field, ●=measurement
◯|◯ → ●? (particles interact → measurement uncertain?)
◉∃∀◯ ∧ ●→*◯ (field contains all particles and measurement reveals important particle)

AI System Description
@AI: ◯=model, ◉=architecture, ●=training_data
◯∧●→◯+ (model processes training_data becomes better model)
◉∃(◯∧◯∧◯) (architecture contains model and model and model)

Complex Query
@knowledge: ◯=concept, ●=fact, ◉=domain
(◯∃●)∧(●!)?@◉ (concept contains fact and fact certain? about domain)

ADVANCED FEATURES
Recursive Structures

◯∃◯∃◯ = nested containment
◯→◯→◯ = transformation chain
◯↔◯↔◯ = relationship network

Quantified Expressions

∀◯∧● = all entities process information
∃◯→◯+ = some entity becomes better
¬∃◯∧● = no entity processes information

Probabilistic Reasoning

◯~→◯ = entity probably transforms
●!~0.9 = information certain probability 0.9
◯?|◯~ = entity unknown given entity probable


INTEGRATION PROTOCOLS
With Natural Language
Human: "How do neural networks learn?"
Nexal: `@ML: ◯=network, ●=data, ◎=backprop | ◯∧●→◎→◯+`

With Code
Python: def train(model, data): return backprop(model, data)
Nexal: `◯∧●→◎→◯+`

With Formal Logic
Logic: ∀x(P(x) → Q(x))
Nexal: `∀◯(◯∧●→◯+)`

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Token Minimalism: Express maximum meaning in minimum symbols
Compositional Predictability: Meaning emerges from systematic combination
Context Awareness: Heavy use of context to reduce redundancy
Scalable Complexity: Simple base + unlimited composition
AI-Native: Designed for machine parsing and generation
Universal Applicability: Domain-agnostic with specialized extensions
